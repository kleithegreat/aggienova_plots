# ColorBandSelector.tsx

The `ColorBandSelector` component allows the user to select two color bands for plotting color differences.

## Dependencies
- `usePlotSettings`: A custom hook from the `PlotSettingsContext` for accessing and modifying the plot settings.
- `Select`, `MenuItem`, `FormControl`, `InputLabel`: Components from the `@mui/material` library for rendering the color band selection dropdowns.

## State
The component does not have its own state. It relies on the `firstColor` and `secondColor` states from the `PlotSettingsContext`.

## Event Handlers
- `handleFirstColorChange`: Updates the `firstColor` state in the `PlotSettingsContext` when the first color band is changed.
- `handleSecondColorChange`: Updates the `secondColor` state in the `PlotSettingsContext` when the second color band is changed.

## Rendering
The component renders two dropdown menus using the `Select` component from `@mui/material`. The first dropdown allows selecting the first color band, and the second dropdown allows selecting the second color band. The available color options are defined in the `colorOptions` array.
